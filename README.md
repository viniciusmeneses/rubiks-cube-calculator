> Minimalist calculator that shows the number of possible combinations of the Rubik's Cube

**rubiks-cube-calculator** shows the possible combinations depending of the Rubik's Cube size. It was developed by me for a friend using the following libraries:

- [Skeleton CSS Boilerplate](http://getskeleton.com/)
- [bignumber.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js/)
- [Factorials](https://github.com/sankage/factorials)

[**Demo available here!**](http://rubiks-cube-calculator.surge.sh/)
